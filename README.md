<h1 align="center">📊 Freshco Hypermarket Sales Analysis (Excel Project)</h1>

### ⭐ Overview  
The Freshco Hypermarket Sales Analysis project examines sales data to understand how different products, categories, and time periods contribute to overall business performance. The focus is to convert raw Excel data into insights that highlight sales trends, growth patterns, and operational opportunities. This project demonstrates how structured analysis can help a retail business improve decision-making and identify areas requiring attention.

### 🚀 Key Features  
This project includes end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and dashboard development. The raw sales file was cleaned by removing duplicates, fixing inconsistent entries, and organising fields for analysis. Additional metrics such as Total Revenue, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Discount Impact were created to make the dataset more meaningful. Pivot tables were used to explore performance across product categories, customer groups, regions, and months, followed by pivot charts to visualise these patterns clearly.  
An interactive dashboard was built using slicers, KPIs, and visual charts to help users filter results and understand the business from multiple angles. The analysis highlights top-performing products, peak sales periods, demand patterns, and low-performing categories that may need operational focus.
